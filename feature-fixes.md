1. When user completes, show a pop up. When there are incorrect blocks, display: "you have mistakes!" When user completes correctly, display: "Congratulations! You have completed the puzzle". Don't display the current banner "Puzzle solved! Every filled cell satisfies the clues" under the title - display "Congratulations" before the puzzle board widget, which should go away when user generates another puzzle.
2. Add a player timer that shows how long user took to finish puzzle
3. Add state management, so that user can undo and redo. Undo with 'z' key, redo with 'x' key
4. Also map WASD to arrow keys to navigate blocks
5. Add "check mistakes" button which should highlight blocks that have mistakes
6. Completes the game when user has inputed all the filled blocks, and don't have any blocks that should be blank that are filled. = user doesn't need to fill in all the cross outed blocks to complete the game
7. Update UI, don't use blue gradient for each block, just use a single blue color
8. Also make the currently selected block border thicker.
