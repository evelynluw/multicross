1. Controller support: like how picross switch game is like
2. Medium clue dimming strategy is not correct still. In typical picross games, the individual hints/clues don't grey out until they're surrounded with x (or one side is next to the puzzle border, and the other side is touch x); or if there are multiple possibilities, if a series of block can be of multiple "2"s in a row clue of "2 2 2", don't dim any of them, especially to not give it away.
3. when doing consecutive filling, don't "switch" the status of the blocks we are passing thorugh
