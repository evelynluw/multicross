1. use x and c for controls
2. cpu usage on firefox or edge super high - workers didn't get killed after we find a puzzle? must fix
3. worker spawn is not consistent?
4. clue dimming is too aggressive
usually hints don't grey out until they're surrounded with x; or it has multiple possibilities
5. controller support
6. consecutive filling when holding fill + arrow or cross + arrow
